## About This Tool

This Streamlit app provides a **very simplified estimate** of the A-weighted maximum sound pressure level (LAFmax) in a room beneath a concrete slab when a heavy object is dropped on the floor above.  
It models the problem with basic plate theory, a two-room energy balance, and simple A-weighting.  
**It is intended for quick “what-if” exploration only**; for full guidance on good acoustic design practice, please refer to the *ProPG: Planning & Noise — Good Acoustic Design* (GAG) document.
